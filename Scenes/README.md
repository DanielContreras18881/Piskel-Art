A scene is a **collection** of props, environments and characters.

- **The naming convention** for scenes is **scn_environmentName_sceneName_version**
	- Examples:
		- scn_park_day_childrenPlaying
		- scn_park_night
		- scn_park_winter
		- scn_park_spring 

- All scenes must use submitted environments. So, when making a scene, submit the environment separately as well.
